%unresolved issues: how to make the chapter reference the current chapter? How to reset the enotez after each printout? 

\documentclass[12pt]{report}
\usepackage[bottom]{footmisc}%this makes footnotes that stick to the bottom of the page
%use "symbol*" to get symbolic footnotes 

%endnote stuff. It's quite involved at times 
\usepackage{enotez} %for endnotes. There's a ton of stuff you can do with this!
%see the manual: https://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/enotez/enotez_en.pdf

\DeclareInstance{enotez-list}{section}{paragraph}{heading=\chapter*{Big heading}}
\setenotez{reset = true, list-style=section,split=chapter,split-title=Chapter \thechapter  notes!,counter-format=arabic}
%reset every chapter. The endnotes will be under a "section" 
%see this post https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/255520/enotez-package-how-to-format-split-section-headings

\AtEveryEndnotesList{This text goes before every endnotes list (you can have more than one)}
% \AtEveryListSplit{Text before every split}


\begin{document}
\chapter{This is one chapter}
This\footnote{this is a footnote} and that. This is\footnote[23]{Another footnote with a forced number}. What about a rainy day?\footnotemark. I don't know. 

\footnotetext{I made the footnote text later!}

And here is how we make an endnote\endnote{Testing} and \endnotemark 

\endnotetext{here}


\chapter{This is another chapter}
More text goes here\endnote{Endnote from another chapter}
\printendnotes


\chapter{Another chapter for demo}
Here's an endnote after we print it once\endnote{Again!}

\printendnotes
