\part{Hi i'm a part}
This is a part. Parts allow you to organize larger thoughts. Note how a part's text is separated from the cover page. I'm going to add some lipsum to fill up space 

\lipsum[1]

\chapter{Hi i'm a chapter}
This is a chapter. Note how chapters fill up less space. 

Chapters and parts are only available in report and book classes 

\lipsum[1]

\section{Hi I'm a section}
This section allows you to organize ideas inside a chapter.


\section*{Hi I'm an uncounted section}
Anything with a "*" will not be indexed by number. 

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Hi I'm a subsection}
\lipsum[1]

\subsubsection{Subsubsection here}
\lipsum[1]

\paragraph{Paragraph here}
\lipsum[1]


\subparagraph{Subparagraph here}
\lipsum[1]

And that's as small as it gets
