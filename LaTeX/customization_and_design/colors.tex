{\color{blue} this is a color switch!}
%red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, gray, white, darkgray, lightgray
%brown, lime, olive, orange, pink, purple, teal, violet 

Inline color is achieved by \textcolor{red}{this}

To highlight, try \colorbox{yellow}{this}. 

% To make your own colors, use these options (there are many!)
\definecolor{mypink1}{rgb}{0.858, 0.188, 0.478}
\definecolor{mypink2}{RGB}{219, 48, 122}
\definecolor{mycolor}{hsb}{219, 48, 122}
\definecolor{mypink3}{cmyk}{0, 0.7808, 0.4429, 0.1412}
\definecolor{mygray}{gray}{0.9}
\definecolor{Mycolor2}{HTML}{00F9DE}
\definecolor{Mywave}{wave}{380} %literally a wavelength!
\colorlet{myviolet}{red!70!blue!20!} %remaining 10% is filled with white 

And now we are in \textcolor{mypink1}{pink!!}

And now we are in \textcolor{Mywave}{deep violet}

Here we use hex code to make \textcolor{Mycolor2}{another color}

We can also use friendly mixing to make \textcolor{myviolet}{other colors}

To set the entire page background: use \pagecolor{mygray}
